** Callback hooks including Namespace support and monitoring all committed diffs.
** All callbacks are on folio actor, so processing must be fast and anything
** expensive should be dispatched to other actors
**
@NoDoc
const mixin FolioHooks
{
  ** Def namespace is available
  abstract Namespace? ns(Bool checked := true)

  ** Callback before diff is committed during verify
  ** phase. An exception will cancel entire commit.
  ** Pass through FolioContext.commitInfo if available.
  abstract Void preCommit(Diff diff, Obj? cxInfo)

  ** Callback after diff has been committed.
  ** Pass through FolioContext.commitInfo if available.
  abstract Void postCommit(Diff diff, Obj? cxInfo)

  ** Callback after his write.  Result is same dict returned from future.
  ** There is no cxInfo since his writes may be coalesced.
  abstract Void postHisWrite(Dict result)
