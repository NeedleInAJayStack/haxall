# Haxall Overview
Haxall is an open source software framework for the Internet of Things. 
It includes an extensive toolkit for working with [Project Haystack](https://project-haystack.org/) 
data. Use it right out of the box as a flexible IoT data gateway which runs at 
the edge. Haxall is written in [Fantom](https://fantom.org/) with 
runtime support for both the Java VM and JavaScript environments.
